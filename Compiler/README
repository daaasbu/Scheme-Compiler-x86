All expected tests passed. 
I worked with Ryan Rozanski, Taylor Weatherly, and Andy Jacobs on the entire assignment.

Special thanks to Tim and Rachel on flatten-program on how to handle the begin line w/ catamorphisms.

Special thanks to Andy for realizing that we weren't checking the range of integers in verify scheme.

Special thanks to Ryan for realizing we weren't using leaq in generate.
